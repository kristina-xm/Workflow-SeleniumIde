This repository demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build and UI testing processes for a .NET project.

### The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to handle the following tasks:

- **Build**: Compiles the project to ensure the codebase is error-free and builds successfully.
- **UI Testing**: Executes automated UI tests using Chrome WebDriver to validate application behavior.

### Summary of the workflow process
- Sets up .NET environment
- Sets up Chrome
- Builds the project
- Runs UI tests
